1. What is JS loader?
---------------------
(1) common way of loading js by <script> tag blocks web site loading.
(2) script loader loading js asynchronously and in parallel.
(3) script loader makes it possible to use the function like "include" for c.

2. The difference of CommonJS, AMD, and RequireJS.
--------------------------------------------------
CommonJS and AMD are specifications (or formats) on how modules and their dependencies should be declared in javascript applications.
RequireJS is a script loader library that is AMD compliant

(1)	AMD is Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) API.
	RequireJS implements the AMD API.  ---> client side.
	
(2) CommonJS is a project to define a common API and ecosystem for JavaScript. One part of CommonJS is the Module specification.
	Node.js implements the CommonJS module spec.   ---> server side.
	
3. The important concepts about JS loader.
------------------------------------------
require:	require -function to fetch dependencies.
exports:	exports variable to export module contents and some module identifier.
define:		allows the module to declare its dependencies before to being loaded
